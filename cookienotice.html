            <h5>2. What are Cookies, which ones do we use and how can you opt-out?</h5>
            <p>2.1 A cookie&nbsp;is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer or mobile device by the user's&nbsp;web browser&nbsp;while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember&nbsp;stateful&nbsp;information (such as items added in the shopping cart) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons,&nbsp;logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.</p>
            <p>2.2 Like many other websites, we also use cookies on ours. Different cookies have different purposes but also different lifespans. The lifespan of a cookie determines how long a cookie will remain on your computer before it deletes itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
            <p>2.3 Browsers may accept or reject cookies automatically but allow you to change these settings. The help menu on most browsers will tell you how to change your browser setting as to cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies all together. You can also disable or delete cookies you have previously accepted if you wish to. To find out how to manage cookies on the following browsers, follow the provided link:</p>

            <h5>3. What are pixels and social plug-ins, which ones do we use and how can you opt-out?</h5>
            <p>We also use other technologies on our Website which allow us and Third Party Providers to offer you a more personalized and engaged web experience, e.g. by offering you advertisements on your social media channels that are more relevant to you or by allowing you to share your experiences on our Website via social media. We therefore use the following technologies:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Facebook pixels.</strong> Facebook pixels are small pieces of software and are nearly invisible pixel-sized “dots” on our Website which create a link between your visit to our Website and Facebook. When the pixel loads, Facebook places a so-called “fr”-cookie on your computer, which helps Facebook to provide you with more personalized advertisements, but also to measure and improve advertisements. This cookie has a lifespan of 90 days. More information on Facebook cookies can be found here: <a tabindex="0" href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/</strong></span></a>. Please note that when the “fr”-cookie is placed, Facebook is able to follow your surfing behavior across other websites which have implemented a Facebook pixel or Facebook social plug-in.</li>
            <li><strong>Social plugins.</strong> Social plug-ins are small pieces of software which create a link between your visit to our Website and the social media platform of a Third Party Provider. The social plug-in will let the Third Party Provider know that you have visited our Website and may let the Third Party Provider receive cookies he has placed on your computer beforehand. We use social plug-ins of the following Third Party Providers:</li>
            <li>Facebook (<a tabindex="0" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins</strong></span></a>)</li>

Note that we have no control over how these social plug-ins work, the data that they collect or what the Third Party Provider does with this information. For more information on how these Third Party Providers use your personal data collected via their social plug-ins, you are kindly referred to their respective privacy policies.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
